//This is my journal prompt for March 7
// Today I learnt how to define different values with he correct variable type. For example, to define a number, you would have to use the int variable, and not the string or float. A float is used for a number, but it is used for a number with a decimal.

//code:
string Name = ("Bob");
int Num = 3;
float Numd = 34.4f;
Console.Write("Hello, ");
Console.Write(Name);
Console.Write("! You have ");
Console.Write(Num);
Console.Write(" messages in you inbox. The temperature is ");
Console.Write(Numd);
Console.Write("celsius.");

//output: Hello, Bob! You have 3 messages in you inbox. The temperature is 34.4celsius.
