For my 2D game, I chose the theme of a mouse trapped inside of a cave which is looking for cheese along with its way out.
This makes my game a maze game. 
For my character I have a mouse. For my background, I have a pattern that looks like insade of a cave.
The tools I used for this assignment was pixelart to draw all the game objects I needed. For example, the mouse, cheese, and background.
