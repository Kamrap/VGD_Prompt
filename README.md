# VGD_Prompt

Assignmnt 6 relection questions:

What changes you made to the script(s): The changes I made to the script was I added a function that detects if a collisionn occured with the player and the collectable token, which is cheese for my game. I added another function that will add one to the shared score which is the score that is shown in game. Then there is one more function that makes the cheese disappear once a collision is detected.

Challenges you faced: The challenge I faced while making my game was getting the score to work because when I first created a script for the score, the score in the game never went up when I collected the cheese.

How you solved them: I solved this problem by adding a line of code that will write in the console whenever I collect the cheese so I know what is not correct and working properly. I then tested it and whenever I collected the cheese, the score in the console didn't add up properly because there was a different score counter for each of the cheese. This means that the I needed to add a share score script that will take the score from each of the cheese and add it up into one score.

What youâ€™re most proud of in your game so far: I'm proud of the score function and collectable items that are in the game because that is the main goal of the game and it make the game more fun to play because you have to collect all teh cheese insted of just finding the exit like in other maze games.
