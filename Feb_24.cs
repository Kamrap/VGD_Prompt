//unit 5 code:
var message = "Hello World!";
message = "hello";
Console.WriteLine(message);

// unit 6 code:
var name = ("Bob! ");
var mail = (3);
var temp = (34.4m);

Console.Write("Hello, ");
Console.Write(name);
Console.Write("You have ");
Console.Write(mail);
Console.Write(" messages in your inbox. The temperature is ");
Console.Write(temp);
